<h1>Metrocar Funnel Analysis</h1>
<h3>1.) Project Overview</h3>
This project involved a <b>funnel analysis</b> for <b>Metrocar</b>, a company similar to Uber. The primary goal was to identify where users dropped off in their journey through the app, starting from downloading the app to leaving reviews. Additionally, we analyzed which platform (mobile vs. web) was most popular among users and explored whether price surging could optimize performance during peak hours.

The funnel was broken down into 7 key steps, and the analysis provided actionable insights into where the largest user drop-offs occurred, and how Metrocar could improve user retention and experience.

<h3>2.) Key Findings</h3>
1. <b>Funnel Drop-offs:</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>50% drop-off from Ride Acceptance to Ride Completion.</li>
<li>A 30% reduction between Sign-ups and Ride Requests.</li>
<li>30% decline from Payment to Review Completion.</li>
<li>The most significant drop occurred between Ride Request and Ride Acceptance (36%).</li>
</ul>
2. <b>Platform Usage:</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>The mobile app is the most commonly used platform, while the web app sees very little usage.</li>
<li>Marketing efforts should focus primarily on mobile platforms.</li>
</ul>
3. <b>GPS and Navigation Issues:</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>25% of complaints from 46,458 one-star reviews were related to GPS inaccuracies and navigation problems. This includes drivers getting lost or arriving late due to inaccurate estimated arrival times.</li>
</ul>
4. <b>Recommendations:</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Timeliness and reliability: Target a waiting time of 1-2 minutes to reduce client loss and improve Metrocarâ€™s reputation.</li>
<li>Implement surge pricing during peak hours to motivate drivers, reduce wait times, and increase profits. Suggested price increases are 10%-20% during peak hours (8:00-10:00 and 16:00-20:00).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.) Methodology</h3>
1. <b>Funnel Analysis:</b> The user funnel was analyzed from the moment users downloaded the app, proceeding through key stages such as sign-ups, ride requests, ride acceptances, and review submissions.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>The largest drop-offs were identified and addressed in our recommendations.</li>
</ul>
2. <b>Platform Usage:</b> We analyzed user behavior to determine whether they used the mobile app or the web app to complete rides. The mobile platform had a significantly higher usage rate.<br><br>
3. <b>Surge Pricing Analysis:</b> We examined the impact of surge pricing on driver motivation, user wait times, and profits during peak hours.

<h3>4.) Tools Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Pandas for data processing and analysis</li>
<li>Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualizations</li>
<li>Postgresql</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.) Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Address GPS issues:</b> Improve navigation accuracy and estimated arrival times to reduce negative reviews.</li>
<li><b>Implement surge pricing:</b> Test surge pricing during peak hours to improve driver availability and reduce waiting times.</li>
<li><b>Optimize mobile app:</b> Focus marketing and development efforts on the mobile app, as it is the primary platform for users.</li>
</ul>
